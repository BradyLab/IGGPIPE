Usage:

Before running your data, make sure you test your installation by copying file
allParameters.test.template to allParameters.test and editing it, searching for
'# CHANGE' and making changes for your system, then run this command:

     make PARAMS=allParameters.test ALL | tee logFiles/makeLog_test.txt

It should run through to completion fairly quickly with no errors.  When it is
finished, compare files X and Y with the command 'diff X Y', where X and Y are:
X = outTestHP10/MarkersOverlapping_K10Km4Lm100Dm10Dx2000Am100Ax2000ADm10ADx100ND2mF1XL15DT10.tsv
Y = MarkersOverlapping_test.tsv
(relative to IGGPIPE directory).  There should be no differences between them.
BTW, the resulting IGG markers are useless since they are based on only part of
the genome.

To run the entire pipeline on your own data, invoke 'make' as follows:

     make PARAMS=filename ALL | tee logFiles/makeLog.txt

Here, 'filename' is the name of the parameter file you want to use to run the
pipeline.  This file would be an edited copy of allParameters.template, such as
'allParameters.XY' if for example you were using genomes X and y and named your
edited file with XY in the name.)  'ALL' is called the make 'target'.

Note that it may take many hours to run everything through to completion.  If an
error occurs, try to find the cause and fix it, then rerun the same 'make' command.
All steps that have already completed successfully are not re-run.

Rather than running the entire pipeline all at once as shown above, you may
choose to run one pipeline step at a time and inspect its output before going
on to the next step.  To do this, run the following 'make' commands in the
order shown.  Each step specifies a different target name, and each one will
show the names of file(s) that are produced.

     make PARAMS=filename getSeqInfo    GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename getContigFile GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename getKmers      GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename kmerStats     GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename sortKmers     GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename kmerIsect
     make PARAMS=filename getGenomicPos GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename splitKmers    GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename findLCRs
     make PARAMS=filename findINDELs
     make PARAMS=filename getDNAseqs    GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename findPrimers
     make PARAMS=filename ePCRtesting   GENOME=ALL
     make PARAMS=filename removeBadMarkers
     make PARAMS=filename plotMarkers

Several steps must be repeated for EACH GENOME.  In those steps, the genome
number is specified using GENOME=# on the command line, with # varying from 1
to N_GENOMES.  Or, use GENOME=ALL as shown above to automatically repeat the
step for all genomes at one time.  You could start with GENOME=ALL, but if you
have trouble, try doing it with GENOME=1 first.

Note that '| tee logFiles/makeLog.txt' causes all 'make' output to be written to
text file 'makeLog.txt' in the 'logFiles' directory, so you have a record of it,
in addition to writing it to the console.

If a step has already finished running successfully and you try to re-run that
step, 'make' will report that those files are up to date, and will do nothing.
To force 'make' to re-run a step, you must either delete the files created by
that step, or use the CLEAN=1 argument to tell 'make' to delete the files.  An
example of this is:

     make PARAMS=filename CLEAN=1 findLCRs

This deletes files created by the 'findLCRs' step.  If 'make' is re-run, with
the 'findLCRs' or 'ALL' target for example, it will rebuild those files and all
other files that were derived from them.  To delete ALL files that were built
by the pipeline, use this command:

     make PARAMS=filename CLEAN=1 ALL

If you want to delete all files in the output directory, regardless of their
names and whether or not they were built using the current parameter settings,
use this command (the output directory that is cleaned is defined in the PARAMS
file as DIR_IGGPIPE_OUT):

     make PARAMS=filename CLEAN_OUT_DIR=1 ALL
