# Minimum number of sequential k-mers required to call a locally conserved

# markers.  If you want LCRs for another purpose such as a reliable Indel
# Group list or for doing whole genome alignment, a larger value is advised.
# This should be at least two more than twice MINFLANK (defined below),
# since that is the minimum number of k-mers in an LCB that could result
# in an Indel Group call.

KMIN := 2


# Minimum acceptable length of an LCR in base-pairs.  This is normally equal
# to the minimum acceptable amplicon size AMIN (defined below), although it
# could be larger.  Smaller values make more LCRs and increase computation time.

LMIN := 300


# Minimum distance in bp between two adjacent k-mers in an LCR.  If two k-mers are
# closer than this, the second one of the close pair is discarded.  This prevents
# a series of back-to-back k-mers in a conserved region from satisfying the KMIN
# setting or MINFLANK setting.  A value in the range of k would be reasonable.

DMIN := 5


# Maximum distance in bp between two adjacent k-mers in an LCR.  If two adjacent
# k-mers are farther apart than this in any genome, the k-mers serve to split the
# LCR into two LCRs at that point.  This value limits the maximum length of one
# indel within an Indel Group or LCR.  This is normally set equal to the maximum
# acceptable amplicon size AMAX (defined below), although it could be larger.

DMAX := 1500


# Minimum IGG marker amplicon size in any genome.

AMIN := 300


# Maximum IGG marker amplicon size in any genome.  The amplicon size will always
# be less than DMAX also.  This also limits the maximum Indel Group size.

AMAX := 1500


# For a given IGG marker, when the smallest amplicon size is AMIN, this is the
# minimum ADDITIONAL bp's of size required for the next larger amplicon.  If
# there are only two genomes or if NDAMIN is 2 (defined below), then if one
# genome's amplicon size is AMIN, the other's must be at least AMIN+ADMIN.
# For the purpose of finding Indel Groups only, this is the minimum Indel
# Group size that will ever be found.

ADMIN := 50


# For a given IGG marker, when the largest amplicon size is AMAX, this is the
# minimum FEWER bp's of size required for the next smaller amplicon.  If there
# are only two genomes or if NDAMIN is 2 (defined below), then if one genome's
# amplicon size is AMAX, the other's must be no more than AMAX-ADMAX.
#
# Interpolation is linear between ADMIN and ADMAX.  The amplicon sizes for
# each genome are sorted smallest first, then the interpolated ADMIN/ADMAX
# value is applied to each amplicon except the last, and if fewer than NDAMIN
# genomes meet the test, the marker is discarded.
#
# The idea behind ADMIN/ADMAX is to require amplicons to be different enough in
# size that they can be easily distinguished on a gel, but that required size
# difference may scale up as the amplicon sizes grow.
#
# For the purpose of finding Indel Groups only, this should be set equal to ADMIN.

ADMAX := 300


# Minimum number of distinct amplicon sizes for each marker.  Set this to the
# number of genomes if you want distinct amplicon sizes for each genome.  Set
# it to a smaller value (>= 2) if fewer distinct sizes are acceptable.  For
# two genomes, this is always set to 2.  If for example there were 3 genomes
# and you set this to 3, all amplicons of a marker must be a different size,
# but if you set this to 2, as long as two genomes have different amplicon
# sizes, the marker is accepted (i.e. two genomes might have the same or
# similar-sized amplicons, but the third genome would have a different size).
NDAMIN := 2


# Minimum number of k-mers to the left of the left-side Indel Group k-mer and to
# the right of the right-side Indel Group k-mer.  May be 0 for none.  The Indel
# Group k-mers are the two common unique k-mers, one on each end of an Indel
# Group, at which primers are designed.  An Indel Group can require only those
# two k-mers, if MINFLANK is 0.  The number of k-mers that must be present in
# the LCR to create a candidate marker is at least 2+2*MINFLANK.  By setting
# this to a value larger than 0, you might decrease the odds that a single
# random common unique k-mer on the LCB could trigger creation of an IGG marker,
# but since e-PCR testing of candidate primers will reject bad random markers,
# there is no reason not to leave this set to 0.  For the purpose of finding
# Indel Groups only, you may want to use a larger value than 0.

MINFLANK := 0


# Two files of Indel Groups are produced, one of overlapping Indel Groups and
# another of non-overlapping Indel Groups.  Likewise, two files of IGG markers
# are produced, one of overlapping markers and another of non-overlapping.
# You may be interested in one or the other, overlapping or non-overlapping,
# or perhaps both.
#
# To explain the meaning of "overlapping" in this context, consider two Indel
# Groups or markers that follow one after another, the first bounded by k-mers
# A and B, and the second bounded by k-mers C and D.  Suppose that both AB and
# CD satisfy the parameters above such as AMIN and AMAX.  Now, it is entirely
# possible that AD also satisfies those parameters.  If it does, it will be
# included in the overlapping Indel Group and IGG marker files along with AB
# and CD, even though its amplicon includes both the AB and the CD amplicon
# regions, i.e. there is redundancy in the Indel Groups and IGG markers within
# the overlapping files.
#
# The files of non-overlapping Indel Groups and IGG markers are created by
# removing some Indel Groups or IGG markers from the set of overlapping ones,
# so that after removal none of the Indel Groups or IGG markers overlap.
#
# Two different methods are provided for determining which Indel Groups and
# markers to remove, and the following parameter chooses the method.  It must
# be the value MIN or else MAX, meaning:
#   MIN: when a set of Indel Groups/markers overlaps, the SHORTEST Indel
#       Group/marker within the genome being tested is retained, and any Indel
#       Groups/markers that overlap it are removed.  (I.e. shortest amplicons).
#   MAX: when a set of Indel Groups/markers overlaps, the LONGEST Indel
#       Group/marker within the genome being tested is retained, and any Indel
#       Groups/markers that overlap it are removed.  (I.e. longest amplicons).
# That removal process is repeated until no more Indel Groups/markers overlap.
# It is repeated for each genome as it is possible two Indel Groups/markers
# might overlap in one genome but not another.
#
# Therefore you would set this to MIN if you want to bias towards getting
# shorter amplicons, and to MAX to bias towards longer ones.

OVERLAP_REMOVAL := MIN


# Number of base pairs of additional sequence to retrieve on each side of each
# of the two anchor k-mers of an IGG marker, for the purpose of designing
# primers.  Primer parameters such as minimum and maximum size, and all other
# parameters, are set in a parameter file used by primer3 to design the primer.
# The value 2*EXTENSION_LEN + k is the maximum possible primer length.  Set
# EXTENSION_LEN large enough that you create multiple sites at which primers
# could possibly be found.  The maximum allowed setting for this is 50.  If
# this is >= minimum primer length, then it is possible a primer will be made
# in the extension region and not including ANY of the unique k-mer bases.
# This might make the primer less likely to be unique, but the e-PCR testing
# of the primers will catch those situations and reject those primers.  A
# value of 20 with k=14 provides 54 base-pairs of sequence in which to design
# a primer.  Note that N's are placed at positions where genomes differ in the
# extended regions on either side of the k-mer, so that primer3 will not design
# a primer on that position.  This means many candidate markers will fail to get
# a primer designed and so will be rejected.  All bases of the k-mer are of
# course identical across all genomes.

EXTENSION_LEN := 15


# Maximum deviation in base pairs from expected amplicon size of off-target
# amplicons discovered by e-PCR (electronic PCR) testing of the candidate
# markers.  Set this to a value where, if there is an off-target amplicon
# whose size is within this amount of the target amplicon size, then you want
# that marker to be marked bad and deleted.

EPCR_MAX_DEV := 2500


# Size, in base pairs, of a "hash word" in the e-PCR program.  This parameter has
# two different effects, unrelated unfortunately.  First, it determines the size
# of the data structure used for searching sequence data for primers, and in this
# context, a larger value uses more memory but can speed up the e-PCR operation,
# while a smaller value uses less memory but can cause inefficient use of hash
# tables, resulting in slow operation.  Second, it sets the number of base pairs
# starting at the 3' end of each primer, which must match EXACTLY with no gaps.
# In this context, a larger value means fewer off-target hits will be identified
# and removed as ambiguous markers, while a smaller value means more off-target
# hits will be identified and more markers will be removed as being ambiguous.
# Base pairs beyond this number in the primer are subject to the next two
# parameters, EPCR_MAX_MISMATCH and EPCR_MAX_GAPS.  The e-PCR program uses a
# default of 7 for this.  It probably shouldn't be made smaller than that, and
# probably should be made larger.  Larger values will result in more markers.

EPCR_WORD_SIZE := 8


# Maximum number of off-target primer mismatches, in base pairs, within the

# (electronic PCR) testing of the candidate markers.  Set this to a size where,
# if there is an off-target approximate primer match with this many or fewer
# mismatched bases, then you want that marker to be marked bad and deleted.
# Larger values increase computation time and reduce number of markers obtained.

EPCR_MAX_MISMATCH := 0


# Maximum number of off-target primer match gaps, in base pairs, within the

EPCR_MAX_GAPS := 0


# For plotting number and density of final markers, this parameter sets the

PLOT_NDAMIN := 3


# For plotting number and density of final markers, this parameter sets the

# Set TIME_CMDS to YES if you wish to time each pipeline command, NO if not.
# When set to YES, each pipeline command will be executed with the shell command
# '(time <command>) 2>&1'.  The 'time' program executes <command> and times it,
# and when it finishes, it prints out the amount of time it used (on stderr,
# which is redirected to stdout with 2>&1), in this format:
#   real    0m0.002s
#   user    0m0.000s
#   sys     0m0.001s
# These values indicate the amount of time required to execute the command.  For
# details on their interpretation, see 'man time'.
