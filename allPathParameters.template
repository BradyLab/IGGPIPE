# VERBOSE DESCRIPTION OF THIS FILE AND HOW TO EDIT IT

# This is an IGGPIPE "tool path" parameter file template.  Copy this file
# to the file named "allPathParameters.ours", then edit it and set the path
# parameters as described in the comments below.

# This file is included by 'Makefile' to set tool paths to be used by 'make'.

# All tool paths and many tool argument settings required for running the
# IGGPIPE pipeline are defined here.  They should set one time, during IGGPIPE
# installation, in file "allPathParameters.ours", and from then on, no one
# should need to touch these settings.

# This is a TEMPLATE FILE giving an example of how to define each parameter.
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.  COPY THIS FILE to "allPathParameters.ours" and edit
# THAT file.

# This file has been filled in with actual values as EXAMPLES.  CHANGE these
# values to appropriate ones for your system.

# If a pathname here doesn't start with "/", it is relative to the IGGPIPE
# install directory (the WD parameter directory).

# All parameters in this file are 'make' variable assignments.  When 'make' is
# run and reads this file, a variable is replaced by its value when this file
# or Makefile or the allParameters file have '$(VARIABLE_NAME)'.  Some variables
# are defined here and then used in $() constructs in subsequent definitions of
# other variables here.  You can add as many of your own variables as you want
# to this file to help you define directory and file names.

# All system environment variables are automatically predefined as make variables
# by 'make' itself, so you can use $(ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME) to access the
# value of an environment variable.
