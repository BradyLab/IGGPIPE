IGGPIPE
=======
Version v0.0, Aug 2015

The BradyLab/IGGPIPE GitHub repository contains code and documentation for the
software package called *IGGPIPE* (*IGG* **P**ipeline).

*IGGPIPE* analyzes two or more genomes
for length-polymorphic regions bounded by unique sequences and designs PCR
primers within these sequences. The primers can be used to amplify the region
from genomic DNA of any of the species used to create the markers, and the
amplicon size will indicate which species the DNA came from - an *IGG* marker.

*IGG* stands for _Indel Group in Genomes_.
